# Library Management System - SQL Project :

**Objective** :

 The goal of this project is to design and analyze a Library Management Database System using SQL. 
     
     This project simulates real-world library operations and answers key business questions such as: 
     
     • Tracking overdue books and calculating fines. 
     
     • Identifying high-performing employees. 
     
     • Measuring branch-level performance (books issued, returned, and revenue). 
     
     • Understanding customer/member behavior and book rental trends.

**Tools & Technologies Used** :

     • Database: PostgreSQL

     • Interface: pgAdmin 4

 **SQL Concepts Applied**: 
     
      • CRUD Operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT) 
     
      • Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) 
     
      • Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING) 
     
      • Date & Interval Functions (CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL, overdue calculations) 
     
      • Ranking & Ordering (LIMIT, ORDER BY) 

**Project Tasks** :- 

#### #CRUD Operations :
      
     • Insert new book records 
   
     • Update member details 
    
     • Delete issue records 
    
     • Retrieve books issued by a specific employee 
    
     • List members with more than one issued book 
    
**Data Analysis & Business Queries** : 

     • Retrieve all books in a specific category 
     
     • Calculate total rental income by category 
     
     • List members who registered in the last 180 days 
     
     • Show employees with their branch manager’s name and details 

     • Retrieve list of books not yet returned 
     
**Advanced Analysis** :

     • Overdue Books → Identify overdue members & calculate fines ($0.50/day). 
     
     • Branch Performance Report → Books issued, returned, and revenue generated per branch. 
     
     • Top Employees → Employees who processed the most book issues.

**Key Insights** : 
    
    - Some members have multiple overdue books, leading to significant fines. 
    
    - Branches with higher employee activity show higher revenues. 
    
    - Certain categories (e.g., Science Fiction, Classics) generate the most rentals. 
    
    - Top 3 employees process the majority of book issues, indicating workload concentration.
